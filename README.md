# sshpass

Homebrew no longer includes `sshpass` in their core, and I understand it's for a good reason. But I still need to use this tool ocassionally, so I have a simple formula to install it from the [source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass). 

## Installation

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - Mac

Run

```bash
brew tap midnightideas/extras
brew install sshpass
```
